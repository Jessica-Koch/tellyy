# Tellyy

This is a fullstack Javascript application deployed to heroku.

## Techologies

I used a simple express backend and connected to a create react app frontend which has been ejected. The backend is very slim as it is only serving as a middle layer between the true backend(the movie db api).

I chose React as I'm the most comfortable with it as a technology. It provides for easy modularized code and create react app takes a lot of teh configuration of webpack, babel etc off of your plate so that I could focus on building the actual application.

## Future Development

Going forward, I would want to add authentication,that would provide save a user's movie preferences and account information to my own backend.
